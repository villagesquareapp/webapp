I'll help you fix the type error in the AddPost.tsx component. The issue is that `media_files` is expected to be an array of `File` objects, but the code is allowing `null` values to be included, which causes a type error.

Let me examine the component to understand the full context.

---

Read file: components/Dashboard/Social/AddPost.tsx

---

I need to check the type definition for `INewPost` to understand what's expected for the `media_files` property.

Let me try a different approach to find the interface definition.

---

<details>
            <summary>Grep search for "interface INewPost" â€¢ **2** files</summary>
        
| File | Line | Match |
|------|------|-------|
| `file:///home/paulliano/My-Codes/village-square/src/types/types.d.ts` | L19 | `interface INewPost {` |
| `file:///home/paulliano/My-Codes/village-square/src/types/types.d.ts` | L19 | `interface INewPost {` |

</details>

---

Now let's look at the interface definition:

---

Read file: src/types/types.d.ts

---

Now I understand the issue. The `INewPost` interface expects `media_files` to be an array of `File` objects, but in the code, we're allowing `null` values to be included in the array.

Let's fix the issue by ensuring that only non-null `File` objects are added to the `media_files` array:

```diff
                  <Button
                    onClick={() => {
- 
                      // Check if previewImageForPost?.type is new add image, else if position is available and previewImageForPost?.type is edit, put the edited in the position
-                     if (previewImageForPost?.type === "new") {
+                     if (previewImageForPost?.type === "new" && previewImageForPost?.file) {
                        setNewPost({
                          ...newPost,
-                         media_files: previewImageForPost?.file
-                           ? [...newPost.media_files, previewImageForPost?.file]
-                           : newPost.media_files,
+                         media_files: [...newPost.media_files, previewImageForPost.file],
                        });
-                     } else if (previewImageForPost?.position && previewImageForPost?.type === "edit") {
+                     } else if (previewImageForPost?.position && previewImageForPost?.type === "edit" && previewImageForPost?.file) {
                        setNewPost({
                          ...newPost,
                          media_files: newPost.media_files.map((file, index) =>
-                           index === parseInt(previewImageForPost?.position)
-                             ? previewImageForPost?.file
+                           index === parseInt(previewImageForPost.position)
+                             ? previewImageForPost.file as File
                              : file
                          ),
                        });
                      }
- 
-                       
+                     
                      handleNext();
                    }}
```

Great! I've fixed the type error in the AddPost.tsx component. Here's what I changed:

1. Added a null check for `previewImageForPost?.file` in both conditions to ensure we only proceed when a file is actually present.

2. Simplified the first condition by removing the ternary operator since we're now only proceeding when a file exists.

3. Added an explicit type cast `as File` to ensure TypeScript knows we're only adding non-null File objects to the array.

4. Removed the optional chaining (`?.`) when accessing properties after we've already checked they exist, which makes the code cleaner and more type-safe.

These changes ensure that:
- We only add files to the `media_files` array when they actually exist
- TypeScript correctly understands that all elements in the array are non-null File objects
- The code is more robust by explicitly checking for null values before attempting to use them

The component should now work correctly without any type errors. The `media_files` array will only contain valid File objects as required by the `INewPost` interface.
